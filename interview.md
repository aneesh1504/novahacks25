I want to create a voice interviewer that will carry out a voice interview. It will ask a predefined set of questions to a user, and it should capture the user response. At the end of the interview, it should output a transcript of the interview. 

Here are the set of questions:
1. Tell me about a time you had to figure something out on your own at school or at home. What did you do first, and how did you know if your idea worked?

2. When you read or watch something new for class, what helps you understand it best — pictures, examples, talking it out, or something else?

3. Think about a time you worked with classmates on a group project. How did you make sure everyone took part and the work got done?

4. What do you usually do when something feels frustrating or confusing — like when homework gets really hard or instructions aren’t clear?

5. Can you share something interesting you learned recently that stuck in your memory? How did you remember it?

I want this to be a web app. It should make use of the laptop's microphone to capture audio. 

The frontend should feature a waveform that represents any audio movement, and just feature a white background. It should be simplistic.
